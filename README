## Overview and Origin

 Officially launched in 2005. They continued on developing the system until 2011. Around 2012 they created a subsidiary organization called OpenCoin  which helped with the optimization of the payment system. The following year Chris Larsen pivoted the entire operation to be more inline with banking institutions. Their main focus was to become the main protocol used for international payments between banks. So far Ripple has raised a total of 293.8M in funding over 14 rounds. Its safe to say that they are continuing to grow as a healthy company. 
"If you want to enable these technologies you have to work with government regulators including central banks.
 I probably spend 20% of my time flying around the world and meeting with central banks and local regulatory agencies in order to provide that clarity.." Brad Garlinghouse (Ripple CEO) explaing how Ripple works with the central banks to provide a better understanding of how Ripple plans to execute its goals and help regulators understand blockchain.

## Business Activities

Ripple aims to compete with the SWIFT system in cross border payment systems by providing cheaper, faster and more secure payment systems than are provided by the current market leader SWIFT. With the use of xRapid aims to minimize the liquidity costs by providing on-demand liquidity by using the XRP token. Banks that are involved in international transactions are required to hold nostro accounts in other currencies. By holding these accounts it becomes very expensive since the money is looked at as “Dead Capital”. With xRapid small to medium size banks would not have to contact larger institutions to provide liquidity because they would use XRP as the bridge currency. 


Ripples focuses on a global network of banks, financial institutions and payment providers that send money globally. They have announced in 2019 that they acquired more than 300 customers that are located in 45 countries and 6 continents.

## Landscape

SWIFT sitting idle and only making small changes to its payment system isn’t going to change the world. Ripple plans to decrease the cost of cross-border transfers by 60% and be capable of settling that transaction in 4 seconds. While the SWIFT network takes 3 to 5 business days for the same transaction. 

Russias (SPFS) system for Transfer of Financial Messages and China's (CIPS) Cross-Border Interbank Payment System are currently competing with the SWIFT system but only operate in the Asian region unlike the SWIFT system that operates in the western part of the world. Bank API would also be part of this domain but wouldn’t necessarily list it as a company as it is an API. SWIFT is the only contender against Ripple and its recent partnership with Crypto Data provider Chainlink. This partnership helps SWIFT with Cross-Chain Protocol in tradefi play. Some other major companies in this domain include payment processing companies like VISA and Mastercard (which are partnered with Ripple), as well as other blockchaine-based payment provideers like Stellar(Creater Jed McCaleb) and Coinbase. These companies focus more on consumer payments rather than banking payments.

## Recommendations

 With the advancement of carbon credits which will be a huge market in the future. Ripples ability to enter the market and create a exchange for these specific carbon credits could help move the the climate change agenda foward. This would benefit Ripple by creating another stream of income since the market size for carbon credit trading is around 300 bn/year'. Be able to capture some of that market through a tokenized carbon credit would help drive even more growth for the company. By using Ripples ODL (On-Demand-Liquidity) the transfer of carbon credits would be instantaneously. Funding will accelerate carbon removal activity and help modernize the carbon markets. As well as helping companies innovate in the process of carbon removal and building a more climate change focused world.
